# Weather-Application
The aim of this application is to connect to openweathermaps.org API using an ajax request, to get the XML format of the seven daysâ€™ weather forecast and display it on a web page to make it easier for the user to read. The user types in the name of the city they want and the weather information is then displayed on a table. The user will also be able to toggle through to see the graph/chart of the weather for the 7 days. I will be using JavaScript to implement my requests and displaying it on the web page using HTML and I will be styling the web page using CSS. This application can be used by different people like hiker or someone who is going to visit a different city/country.
